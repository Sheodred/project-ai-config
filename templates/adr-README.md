# Architecture Decision Records — <PROJECT>

Each ADR records a decision that will cost money or nerves later if reversed
carelessly. Format: Context, Decision, Options with a scoring table, Consequences.

| ADR | Decision | Status | Gist |
| --- | -------- | ------ | ---- |
| [0001](0001-<slug>.md) | <one line> | Proposed | <why> |

## Add a new ADR

Write one when a decision has at least two of these traits: hard to reverse,
touches more than one service, there was a serious alternative, or in six months
someone will ask "why did we do it this way". Never overwrite an existing ADR —
set its status to `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` and write a new one; the old reasoning
is the context the new decision makes sense in.
